<p>United Continental Airlines fell 3.4 percent on Tuesday after a passenger stormed him to get him out of the plane.
A widely circulated video, an Asian-looking man, was violently kicked out of his plane seat on Monday.
The story began when the airline announced that it had completed its flight from Chicago to Louisville, and called on four volunteers to travel on another flight with appropriate compensation.

The videos show an unidentified man who refused to get up from his seat on the plane and change the flight, making the security men step in and pull him into the corridor.
The passengers documented on their mobile phones the man's protests, and also criticized the way the security personnel handled the person..</p>

<h1>Trump: Dollar is too strong and will hurt our economy</h1>
<img src="../images/dolar.jpg">
<p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The dollar "is gaining too much strength" and will ultimately hurt the US economy, but the Wall Street Journal quoted US President Donald Trump as saying he wanted interest rates to stay at low levels.
Trump said in an interview he would not describe China as a currency manipulator in a US Treasury report released later this week, Reuters reported.
Trump said he respected Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen and left open the possibility of being re-nominated after her current term expires in 2018.

"I think our dollar is gaining too much power and I'm partly responsible for it because people have given me confidence, but that's harmful, and it will eventually bring damage," he said</p>

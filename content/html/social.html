<p>Samsung's top mobile phone leader Koh Dongjin revealed on Thursday that pre-orders for its new Galaxy S8 had surpassed previous S-7 orders.
This information indicates that many customers were not disturbed by the crashes of the NUT 7, last year, which caused the giant North Korean material losses.
The S8 phone is scheduled to be sold in South Korea, the United States and Canada from April 21 and will play a pivotal role in the recovery of the South Korean company after the rapid withdrawal of the NOT 7 device from the market.The new model was welcomed, with some investors and analysts saying it could achieve record sales for the giant company during its first year. "It is still early, but the initial reaction from pre-orders that started in different parts of the world was better than expected," Koh said in a press release. "The S8 will be the safest phone in the Galaxy class so far thanks to the safety measures applied to avoid battery damage that has led to the burning of some of the phones of 7." Analysts expect Samsung to record the best quarterly profit ever between April and June support S8 strong sales and market prosperity Memory chips that m Which is expected to generate record revenues for the sector this year</p>

<h1>Determination of viable planets</h1>

<p>Astronomers say planets orbiting two different planets can be viable, although finding these types of planets is "hard" to the point of the hour.
The planets around two stars are "worth targeting" in the search for another life, the researchers say. A planet located at the right distance from the sun can be "possible."
In a new study published in the journal Nature Com- mission, the researchers studied the climate of the virtual planets using the Kepler Space Telescope, where they found that the "planet orbiting two stars" was eight times the size of Earth."This means that double-star systems are strongly nominated to be viable planets," said Max Pope, a research associate at Princeton University. "We know that finding planets that are likely to be habitable requires a lot of effort," said researcher Sigfried Eagel. "We think double-star systems should be targeted in our search.".</p>
